# FluCoMa Learn

This is the code for the [FluCoMa Learn Website](https://learn.flucoma.org).

## Working Locally

To work locally you will need `node` (> 16.6.0 && <= 19.9.0>) installed on your computer as well as either `npm` or `pnpm`.

### 1. Installing Dependencies

Set your current working directory to this repository with `cd`. Once you are there in your terminal, install all dependencies with: 

`npm i`. 

> [!TIP]
> Replace `npm` with your package manager of choice. At this time, `bun` isn't really supported.

### 2. Starting the Development Server

Once you have the necessary dependencies. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`. A local development server should be started on port `5173`. You can navigate to https://localhost:5173 to see the site in realtime.
