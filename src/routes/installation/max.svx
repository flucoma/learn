## Step 1: Download the Max Package

## Step 2: Move the Package Folder

To install a Max package you need to place it into the `Packages` folder. Select your operating system on the tabs below.

<Tabs>
    <TabList>
        <Tab>MacOS</Tab>
        <Tab>Windows</Tab>
    </TabList>
    <TabPanel>

    On macOS `Packages` is located at `/Users/username/Documents/Max 8/Packages`. Where `username` is the username of your account.

    />

    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>

    On Windows, `Packages` is located at `C:\Users\username\Documents\Max 8\Packages`. Where `username` is the username of your account.

    </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Run Max and Test

Now check that the installation worked.

1. Restart Max.

2. Open <a href='/installation/max-install-test.maxpat' download='max-install-test.maxpat'>this patch</a>.

## Step 4: Quarantine

Because we don't sign the `.mxo` externals with developer credentials, macOS will quarantine them and stop them from running. It is trivial to de-quarantine and Max will even do it for you with your permission. If you see the following popup, click OK.
