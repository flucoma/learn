## Introduction

OnsetSlice calculates slice points in a sound based on changes in its _spectrum_. It makes these judgements based on one of several available metrics which each have their own characteristics. From this, it derives a time-series that describes change from one moment to the next. If that change exceeds the given _threshold_ parameter, a slice point for that event is produced. Let's break this process down step-by-step visually.

## A Visual Example

Let's first start with this vocal recording:

<Audio 
src='/audio/Tremblay-AaS-VoiceQC-B2K.mp3'
label='Tremblay-AaS-VoiceQC-B2K vocal recording'
waveform={true}
/>

If we create a spectrogram from this sound, it visually explicit where significant changes in the spectrum occur. If we align these aurally, these changes coincide with the utterance of each letter from the alphabet.

<Image 
src='/ref/onsetslice/voice-spec.jpg'
alt='spectrogram of a voice recording'
label='Spectrogram of Tremblay-AaS-VoiceQC-B2K'
/>

OnsetSlice measures this change by working pairwise through spectral frames, comparing the difference between successive spectral frames. From this it constructs a feature curve of its own. Points in time when the value of this curve exceeds the threshold are considered as onsets. Furthermore, another condition has to be met: the previous value must be _less than the threshold_. Below is an interactive widget that lets you visualise adjusting the _threshold_ (the horizontal red line) and how this results in the detection of time slices (the vertical red lines).
