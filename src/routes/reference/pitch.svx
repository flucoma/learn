FluCoMa's Pitch object returns both pitch and confidence values. When no pitch can be detected, a pitch of 0 Hz is returned (or -999.0 when the unit is in MIDI note mode).

The confidence output is a value between 0 and 1 indicating how confident the algorithm is _that there is_ a pitch. In effect this can be an estimation of how "noisy" (closer to 0) or "harmonic" (closer to 1) the spectrum is.

The Pitch object has three algorithms to choose from (by setting the `algorithm` parameter):

0. **Cepstrum:** Returns a pitch estimate as the location of the second highest peak in the Cepstrum of the signal (after DC).
1. **Harmonic Product Spectrum:** Implements the Harmonic Product Spectrum algorithm for pitch detection. See reference below.
2. **YinFFT:** (the default) Implements the frequency domain version of the YIN algorithm. See reference below.

The `unit` argument indicates whether the pitch output should be in hertz (indicated by 0) or MIDI note numbers (indicated by 1).
