NMFMorph uses a technique called Optimal Transport to provide real time interpolation between ``source`` and ``target`` bases of a [BufNMF](/reference/bufnmf) decomposition. Using Optimal Transport for the spectral interpolation provides richer results than a simple linear interpolation between spectral shapes. Activations from a BufNMF analysis are also provided to activate the interpolated spectral information through time. 

If ``autoassign`` is set to 1, NMFMorph will determine which bases from ``source`` and ``target`` best match each other, and will interpolate between the matched pairings. If ``autoassign`` is set to 0, NMFMorph will interpolate between bases in the order they have been provided.
