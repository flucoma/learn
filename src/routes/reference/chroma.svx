Chroma is an audio feature that attempts to represent the composition of pitch classes in a sound. Each pitch class, or _"chroma"_, is an equal division of the octave. By default, the Chroma algorithm will return 12 pitch classes which conveniently maps on to a western model of tonal harmony (C, C#, D, D# etc...).

We should be aware that this is not the only way to use this audio feature â€“ the number of pitch classes (chromas) is modifiable. We should also be mindful that the Chroma algorithm is _not_ a fundamental pitch tracker and it won't tell you about the structure of pitch classes, only their relative strength to each other. Furthermore, the entire spectrum is wrapped into a single octave, meaning any notion of register is lost. As such it is useful for perhaps identifying rough tonal components a sound might be comprised of, but nothing about their hierarchy as a chord.

<!-- For example, when the "Bass" sound is playing (click the button), there are moments where the strength of certain pitch classes are obviously the most dominant. Because the sound is monophonic and relatively clear in the recording this tells us what the note might be that is played by the instrumentalist. This however is misleading and we might think it is tracking pitch! Try the "Oboe" sound which is full of harmonically dense multiphonics. The first multiphonic has a relatively strong measurement of the A pitch class. This A is actually the difference tone that is produced by the oboe when it makes this sound and is somewhat concealed by the more prominent high notes.

This is because the Chroma features is capturing the difference tone A, which is somewhat concealed by the higher note. Given this context, make sure you aware of what Chroma can and cannot tell you. -->
