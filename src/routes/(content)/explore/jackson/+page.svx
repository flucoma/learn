## Overview

In episode 22 of the FluCoMa Podcast, we talk with composer of electroacoustic, chamber and orchestral music Yvette Janine Jackson. Yvette makes music for concerts, theater, installation and film, notably in the form of radio operas and narrative soundscape composition. We shall learn about these two practices, as well as Yvettes approach to working with different types of corpora, and diffusion. Taking an overview of her career, we shall learn more about her influences - be it her time at the Electronic Music Center at Columbia and how it influences her work today, her time working the soundboard in theater, or her time working on tall ships!
