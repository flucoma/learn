<p slot="bio">
Darlene Castro Ortiz is a Mexican-American composer and classical guitarist based in Chicago. Her interest in music began at a young age with the violin, first in a youth mariachi band, then in a classical orchestra setting. Inspired by her bilingual upbringing, her creative interest mostly lies in sonification and creating sonic representations of non-musical objects, often using electronics, noise, and extended techniques. Her music draws most of its inspiration from trying to auralize processes or extra-musical objects in order to arrive at vivid, self-contained musical translations. These musical translations can sometimes be literal, other times more veiled and often use visual art, poetry, scientific processes, and active words as starting points. Most recently, her creative research lies in sensors and gesture mapping.

## Overview

In this episode of the FluCoMa Podcast I talk with composer Darlene Castro Ortiz. We discuss some of her creative work and how she approaches ideas of sonification and musical translations. We also discuss one of her latest projects, a piece that makes use of the fluid.mlpregressor and explore her approach to using this kind of neural network within her practice.
