Jorrit Tamminga studied Music & Technology at the Utrecht School of the Arts and at the Institute of Sonology at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague. During both studies he focused on electronic composition, live electronics, spatialization and sound synthesis. His work sounds regularly in different settings all over the globe: in concert halls and venues (Madrid, Amsterdam, Berlin, Istanbul, Venice), festivals (Huddersfield, Murcia, ZÃ¼rich, Stavanger), churches (Mechelen, Utrecht, Antwerp), on the streets, in factories (Goes, Twente) and from towers (New York, Kaunas, Almere).

## Overview

In this second episode of the FluCoMa podcast I talk with Jorrit Tamminga. We discuss his creative process and approach to musicking through some of his collaborations with people like Wim Henderickx and Erik Bosgraaf. We also discuss how he is beginning to incorporate some of the FluCoMa tools into his practice, and how he approaches the learning and teaching of computational techniques.
