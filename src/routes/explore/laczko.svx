## Overview

In this episode of the FluCoMa Podcast I talk with Bálint Laczkó about his recent audiovisual perfomance piece _The Hum_. The piece makes use of many of the FluCoMa tools, and during our conversation, we learn about Bálint's approach to many of the FluCoMa workflows: automatic versus manual slicing; custom feature extraction and combinations of descriptor data; dimensionality reduction and visualisation in 2- and 3-dimensional spaces; data-driven musical interfaces and how to engage with them at performance and compositional levels; corpus curation and construction; and much more!
