## Overview

In this episode of the FluCoMa Podcast I talk with Dr. Anna Xambó who is currently a senior lecturer in Music and Audio Technology at the Leicester Media School at De Montfort University; and a member of the Music, Technology and Innovation - Institute of Sonic Creativity (MTI2). We discuss a number of her research projects, and how they feed into her creative practice. We notably discuss her use of MIR techniques for live-coding, and dealing with large, online, crowd-sourced corpora on a platform such as Freesound.
