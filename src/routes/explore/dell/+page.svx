## Overview

In this third episode of the FluCoMa podcast, I talk to Niamh Dell, currently undertaking a PhD in contemporary performance at the University of York. Dell is an oboist, and you may have seen her perform a piece she co-created with Alex Harker using the FluCoMa toolkit called _Drift Shadow_. In this episode, we learn more about Dell’s practice, her experience creating and performing this piece and how it allowed her approach to performance, and her knowledge of her instrument, to grow.
